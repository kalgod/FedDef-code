# FedDef
Code for our paper-FedDef: Robust Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems Against Gradient Leakage.

See `example.txt` for example running, including training FL-based NIDS, leveraging reconstruction attacks to obtain privacy score and GAN-based adversarial attack.

`data` denotes our dataset, gan_dataset denotes the reconstructed private data by reconstruction attack.

Note that the `(x, y)` pairs under `gan_dataset` directory represent the results with single sample reconstruction, while pairs in `save_bs_5` represent the samples with batch=5 reconstruction attack.

`kitsune_model` includes the trained Kitsune model for evaluating evasion rate against Kitsune.

`save` denotes the saved privacy score during reconstruction attack, while `save_model` includes our trained FL-based NIDS with different defense strategies.

`model` includes some codes for federated learning.

`Autoencoder.py`, `corClust.py` and `KitNET.py` denote partial Kitsune codes to evaluate Kitsune model's classification for adversarial traffic.
